python-source-project
├── src
│   ├── source.py        # Main class for generating synthetic data
│   ├── config.py        # Configuration loading from properties file
│   ├── utils.py         # Utility functions for various tasks
├── .gitignore            # Files and directories to ignore by Git
└── README.md             # Project documentation
```
